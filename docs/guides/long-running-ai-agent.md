# How to Run a Long-Running AI Agent with mokli

mokli can keep agent work alive across turns through sustained goals,
persistent sessions, scheduled automations, local triggers, and a gateway
process that stays running.

## What you will build

- a working local agent
- a persistent chat session
- a long-running goal or automation
- a gateway process for background delivery

## When to use this

Use this when the task is not a one-shot answer: project work, recurring checks,
scheduled summaries, file maintenance, multi-step research, or local triggers
from scripts and build jobs.

## Install

```bash
python -m pip install mokli-ai
mokli onboard --wizard
mokli agent -m "Hello!"
```

## Minimal working example

Start a gateway:

```bash
mokli gateway
```

From the Mokli or a chat session, start a sustained goal:

```text
/goal Review this workspace, identify missing tests, and propose the smallest next fix.
```

For scheduled or trigger-based runs, create the automation from the target chat
so mokli can link it to the correct session and workspace.

## Production notes

- Keep the gateway running for chat apps, Mokli sessions, automations, and local
  triggers.
- Use stable session keys or chat sessions for work that should preserve context.
- Keep goals bounded and explicit about done-ness.
- Review Automations in the Mokli before relying on a schedule.

## Security notes

- Treat long-running goals as delegated work with real tool access.
- Restrict workspaces and shell execution before scheduling unattended tasks.
- Keep chat access narrow so unknown users cannot create goals or automations.

## Troubleshooting

- If a goal appears stuck, inspect the active session and gateway logs.
- If an automation does not run, check that it is linked to a chat/session and
  that the gateway is still running.
- If a local trigger fails, check the command copied from the Mokli Automations
  view.
