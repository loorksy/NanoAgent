# mokli Documentation

Use these docs to get a working agent first, then open a task guide only when you need the next capability. Source-level design and extension details are kept in the contributor section.

Repository docs follow the current source tree and can be newer than the latest package release. For published release docs, visit [mokli.wiki](https://mokli.wiki/docs/latest/getting-started/mokli-overview).

## Start Here

| Your situation | Read this | You are done when... |
|---|---|---|
| Terminals, Python, or API keys are new to you | [Beginner walkthrough](./start-without-technical-background.md) | The browser can send `Hello!` and receive a reply |
| You are comfortable running commands | [Install and Quick Start](./quick-start.md) | `mokli status` is healthy and the Mokli or CLI can get one reply |
| Something already failed | [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) | You have isolated the problem to install, config, model, gateway, channel, or tool access |

The recommended first-run path is:

1. Install mokli.
2. Let the installer open `mokli mokli` on a fresh local desktop.
3. Configure a provider and model in **Settings → Models**.
4. Send `Hello!` before configuring anything else.

Most people do not need to edit JSON for the first run. The Mokli handles the initial provider, model, and local browser settings. SSH, headless, existing-config, and older-release installs retain `mokli onboard --wizard` as a terminal fallback. After the Mokli opens, use **Settings** for models and built-in capabilities, **Settings → Channels** for chat apps, and **Apps** for Agent Plugins, CLI Apps, and MCP integrations.

## Add One Capability

| Choose a hosted, OAuth, company, or local model | [Provider Cookbook](./provider-cookbook.md) |
| Add model fallbacks | [Configure Model Fallback](./guides/configure-model-fallback.md) |
| Enable web search | [Configure Web Search](./guides/configure-web-search.md) |
| Manage Agent Plugins, CLI Apps, or MCP integrations | [Mokli Apps](./mokli.md#apps) |
| Add an MCP tool server | [Configure MCP Tools](./guides/configure-mcp-tools.md) |
| Generate images | [Image Generation](./image-generation.md) |
| Schedule work or create a local trigger | [Automations](./automations.md) |
| Understand and manage long-term memory | [Memory](./memory.md) |
| Run mokli continuously | [Deployment](./deployment.md) |
| Serve the Mokli client over the Agent API | [Mokli deployment](./deploy/mokliui.md) |
| Run separate bots or workspaces | [Multiple Instances](./multiple-instances.md) |
| Call mokli from Python | [Python SDK](./python-sdk.md) |
| Expose an OpenAI-compatible endpoint | [OpenAI-Compatible API](./openai-api.md) |

For shorter, outcome-focused walkthroughs, browse the [task guide index](./guides/README.md).

## Operate mokli

| Need | Read |
|---|---|
| Commands and flags | [CLI Reference](./cli-reference.md) |
| In-chat slash commands | [In-Chat Commands](./chat-commands.md) |
| Config, workspace, gateway, sessions, tools, and memory in plain language | [Concepts](./concepts.md) |
| Provider/model matching and selection | [Providers and Models](./providers.md) |
| Setup and runtime diagnosis | [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) |
| Older development highlights | [Release Archive](./release-archive.md) |

## Reference

Use reference pages to look up an exact option after you know what you are trying to configure:

| Area | Reference |
|---|---|
| Every configuration field and default | [Configuration](./configuration.md) |
| Provider and model behavior | [Providers and Models](./providers.md) |
| Chat channel prerequisites and manual JSON | [Chat Apps](./chat-apps.md) |
| WebSocket authentication and wire protocol | [WebSocket](./websocket.md) |
| Python SDK classes, events, sessions, and hooks | [Python SDK](./python-sdk.md) |
| OpenAI-compatible HTTP routes and payloads | [OpenAI-Compatible API](./openai-api.md) |
| Runtime self-inspection and tuning | [My Tool](./my-tool.md) |

Configuration examples are usually snippets to merge into `~/.mokli/config.json`, not complete replacement files. The docs use camelCase because mokli writes config that way. Keep real API keys, bot tokens, and passwords out of issues and public logs.

## Extend or Contribute

These pages explain implementation and extension points. You do not need them to install or operate mokli.

| Goal | Read |
|---|---|
| Understand source ownership and runtime flow | [Architecture](./architecture.md) |
| Set up a development environment | [Development](./development.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| Add a channel package | [Channel Package Guide](./channel-package-guide.md) |
| Build the Mokli source | [Mokli Development](../mokli/README.md) |

If a command or screen no longer matches these docs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot/issues) with your mokli version, operating system, and the page that needs correction.
